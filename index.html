          <p class="introduction-paragraph" id="p1">Analysis of stocks and other equities can often times be overwhelming and intimidating to the beginner. However, it doesn't have to be this way. Throughout this page, you will be introduced to some of the most crucial aspects of equity analysis. Our goal is to make you a competent investor by the end of this short guide.
          </p>
          <p class="introduction-paragraph" id="p2">Although equity analysis seems like an insurmountable task, when broken down into bite size pieces, it is entirely manageable. There are generally five steps which are crucial in the analysis of a stock, etf, or other equity. In order of importance, these are:

          <p id="p3">This guide assumes that you have a very basic understanding of equities such as stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds. A preliminary understanding of how markets work will also be beneficial. Additionally, although it will not be covered in this guide, an understanding of <code class="code">html</code>, <code class="code">CSS</code>, <code class="code">Python</code>, <code class="code">JavaScript</code>, and <code class="code">Machine Learning</code> are benificial in making quick, calculated financial decisions.

        <header class="header">Fundamental Ratios</header>
          <p id="p4">These are the ratios that you will plug into a screener to distinguish the equities that are worth investigating from those that are not. Some fundamental ratios worth keeping in mind are P/E (Price-to-earnings), P/S (Price-to-Sales), ROE (Return on Equity), and ROA (Return on Assets). Each of these fundamental ratios can be used to get a rudimentary idea of the value of a company.</p>

          <p id="p5">Publicly traded companies are required to provide statements of their financial positions to stockholders and the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission). In their annual reports, you will find a company's earnings report, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and statement of stockholders' equity. Each of these important documents will provide valuable insights into a company's financial positions.
</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="about_the_company">
        <header class="header">About the Company</header>
          <p id="p6">Also found in the annual report, typically before any financial documents, is the important information about the company. Here you will gain an understanding of the inner workings of a company. From the ways in which it makes money, to the members on the board of directors, a wealth of valuable information can be found in the beginning of a company's annual report.

      <section class="main-section" id="broker_recommendations">
        <header class="header">Broker Recommendations</header>
          <p id="p7">Websites such as Zacks Investment Research and Yahoo Finance offer free evaluations of equities. Typically on a scale from one to five, with one being a strong buy recommendation, and 5 being a strong sell recommendation, these rankings should be taken with a grain of salt. Broker recommendations should simply be used to confirm a good equity and should not make or break your decision.

      <section class="main-section" id="technical_analysis">
        <header class="header">Technical Analysis</header>
          <p id="p8">Now that you have found a strong company to invest in, it's time to decide when exactly to buy. Should you buy into it right now, tomorrow morning, or in two weeks? This is where technical analysis comes into play. The most valuable technical indicator when it comes to timing the purchase of an equity is RSI (Relative Strength Index). This number can fall anywhere between 0 and 100, with 30 or below indicating the equity is oversold and 70 or above indicating the equity is overbought. It is often best to purchase an equity when it is oversold as this means it is essentially at a discount price.

          <p id="p9">The world of equity analysis may seem daunting, especially for beginners. However, the journey to becoming a competent investor is not as insurmountable as it might appear. Through the course of this guide, we have demystified the process and broken it down into manageable steps. Our aim is to equip you with the essential tools and knowledge to navigate the world of stocks, ETFs, and other equities effectively. By understanding the fundamental ratios, company financials, and the background of a company, you'll be better prepared to make informed investment decisions.</p>
          <p id="p10">We recognize that this guide assumes a basic understanding of equities and market fundamentals. Having a grasp of how financial markets operate is beneficial as it sets the foundation for equity analysis. Remember that a company's financial disclosures, mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are a goldmine of information. Within these annual reports lie key documents that unveil a company's financial health, including earnings reports, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and stockholders' equity statements.</p>
          <p id="p11">Furthermore, equity analysis is not complete without considering broker recommendations and employing technical analysis for optimal timing. While broker recommendations can provide some guidance, they should be used as a supplementary tool, not as the sole basis for investment decisions. When it comes to timing your investments, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a valuable technical indicator. By focusing on oversold conditions, you can identify equities available at a discount, potentially optimizing your investment strategy. In essence, with the right knowledge and tools, equity analysis becomes a manageable endeavor on the path to financial success.</p>
